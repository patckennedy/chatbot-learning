# 🤖 chatbot-learning  

A hands-on repo for learning chatbot development — following tutorials and building my own spin-off projects.  

---

## 📌 About  
This repo is where I’m learning and practicing chatbot development. I’m following the Udemy course *“Chatbot — The Development Guide 2025” by Eric Roby* and coding along step by step.  

For each tutorial project, I’ll also create a spin-off version of my own. This way I practice applying the same skills in new ways, while also building original chatbot apps for my portfolio and freelance opportunities.

## 📂 Repo Structure

- `project-01_tutorial-*` → Code from the Udemy course  
- `project-01_spin-off-*` → My own version of the project  
- `project-02_*` → And so on...

## 🚀 Progress Tracking  
Each week I’ll update:  
- **Notes** → what I learned, challenges, and key takeaways.  
- **Projects** → both tutorial builds and spin-off versions.  
- **Commits** → small, realistic steps with clear messages.

### ✨ Outcome  
By the end of this course, this repo will be a collection of chatbot apps that show my journey from **beginner** to **portfolio-ready developer**.
